## Introduction
[Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor) ([墙棋 or 步步为营](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%AD%A5%E6%AD%A5%E4%B8%BA%E8%90%A5/4874) in Chinese) is a simple but funny board game.

When I was playing the game with my friend, she thought it was fun and hoped me make it as an Android application. I finished it about a year later.

## Other Instruction
The game can be played with other player or AI. For the AI algorithm, I refer to this [repository](https://github.com/huangmubin/Quoridor).

However, the AI algorithm is still monotonous. Perhaps it can be enhanced by Reinforcement Learning. Maybe I will try it when I have *a lot of free time*.
